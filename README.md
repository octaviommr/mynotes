# MyNotes

A very simple note board application, written for sandboxing and demonstration purposes. It showcases the MERN stack, specially the frontend bit which is my main area of interest and the one I'm passionate about. Below is a breakdown of the most relevant application features:

## Frontend

- TypeScript code for static type checking
- State management using Redux Toolkit (with RTK Query and Reselect)
- Form building and validation using React Hook Form
- Tailwind CSS styling (with Headless UI and Heroicons)
- Accessibility using ARIA roles and attributes and ensuring color contrast
- Global error handling
- Test suite using Jest, React Testing Library and Mock Service Worker

## Backend

- Data modelling and validation using Mongoose
- Authentication using JWTs
- Global error handling
