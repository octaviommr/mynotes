# MyNotes

A very simple note board application, written for demonstration purposes. It showcases the MERN stack and the following features:

- TypeScript frontend for type-safe code
- State management using Redux Toolkit (with Redux Thunk middleware and Reselect memoized selectors)
- Tailwind CSS styling (with Headless UI and Heroicons)
- Form building and validation using React Hook Form
- Contextual application header
- Data modeling and validation with Mongoose
- Authentication and authorization using JWTs
- Global error handling (frontend and backend)
