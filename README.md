# MyNotes

A very simple note board application, written for sandboxing and demonstration purposes. It showcases the MERN stack, specially the frontend bit which is my main area of interest and the one I'm more passionate about. Below is a breakdown of the most relevant application features:

## Frontend

- TypeScript code for static type checking
- State management using Redux Toolkit (with RTK Query and Reselect)
- Form building and validation using React Hook Form
- Tailwind CSS styling (with Headless UI and Heroicons)
- Global error handling
- Testing using Jest and React Testing Library

## Backend

- Data modelling and validation using Mongoose
- Authentication using JWTs
- Global error handling
